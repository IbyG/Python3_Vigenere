#This is project vigenere, started on monday july 29th 2019.
#this program is an encryption program that uses the vigenere square to encrypt
#and decrypt the text, also using a key phrase by sokrates. 
#"true wisdom comes to each of us when we realise how little we understand about life, ourselves and the wold around us"

# encryption: (x) = plaintext char, (y) = key char
# A to (x) = n, e.g A to the letter P is 16 spaces therefore n = 16
# encrypted char = (y) + n therefore T which is the first letter of the key + 16 = I
# encrypted char = I


# decryption: n = count from (y) to encrypted char e.g from T to I is 16 
# n = 16
# decrypted char = A + n therefore A + 16 = P
